# xox-game 

XOX is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

XOX is also called Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland)
